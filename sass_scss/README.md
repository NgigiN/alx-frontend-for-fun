SASS - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets
Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself. It provides mechanisms such as variables, nesting, and mixins, making it easier to read and maintain CSS code.
It was designed by Hampton Catlin in 2006.
